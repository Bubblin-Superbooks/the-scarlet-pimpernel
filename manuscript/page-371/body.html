My coach is ready to take me to Dover. Do you follow me, as swiftly as horses will take you. We meet at nightfall at 'The Fisherman's Rest.' Chauvelin would avoid it, as he is known there, and I think it would be the safest.

Disguised, if you will agree to it, as my lacquey, you will, I think, escape detection.”</p><p>“I am entirely at your service, Madame,” rejoined the young man earnestly. “I trust to God that you will sight the DAY DREAM before we reach Calais. With Chauvelin at his heels, every step the Scarlet Pimpernel takes on French soil is fraught with danger.”</p></div> </div>
